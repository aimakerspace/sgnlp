Welcome to sgnlp's documentation
=======================================

The sgnlp package is a collection of models developed by Singapore's NLP researchers and
implemented using the Pytorch and Transformers frameworks. It is part of the SG-NLP project.

Contents

The documentation contains the following parts:

* **Quickstart** contains information on how to install the package, basic information of how the package works,
  and a simple example.

* **Logging** contains information on how logging is implemented in the package and advanced use cases for logging.

* **Advanced Tutorial** contains in-depth guides for specific models. These guides go into detail on what the model
  is about and how it can be configured for training and inference.

* **API Reference** is meant to be a reference manual with details about all the functions and classes in the package.

What is SG-NLP?
---------------
SG-NLP is a project by AI Singapore's NLP Hub. We aim to bridge the gap between research and industry and promote more
translational research and industry's adoption of NLP techniques.
