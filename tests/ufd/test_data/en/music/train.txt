0	What! Ja WHO? Can't be! This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me. This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed.
1	Not the music from this movie This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber
1	Stick To The Movie, THAT was a treat! Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone. The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal. The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it. Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file. As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED!
0	clapton suck Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallica who rock. PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't buy it at all
0	Dreadful! I don't understand the previous reviews - I found this recording positively dreadful, with Ruthie Henshall being the only one worth listening to. John Sinclair is abominable as George - he sounds like he's doing a (bad) imitation of Michael Crawford in &quot;Hello, Dolly.&quot; He does strange things to his words - I guess he's trying not to sound British, but why is he singing &quot;Summ-ar weath-ar&quot; instead of &quot;summer weather&quot;? The Ilona is a bass - almost literally. &quot;I Resolve&quot; has been lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. To accomodate her, the second part of &quot;I Don't Know His Name&quot; has a truly odd key change. Were she remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate her singing, but she's not worth it. The orchestrations are odd, too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE NOTE of &quot;Days Gone By.&quot; Luckily this is his only song.) The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original) outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the annoying Judy Kuhn.) Get the original or revival recordings instead - this London version I would recommend only to die-hard SHE LOVES ME fans, or masochists. I'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; than listen to this again
