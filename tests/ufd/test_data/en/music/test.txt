1	No Good At All Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities. The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album. Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song. The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason. It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear. The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'. Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording. Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL
1	Recycled goods Having listened to Steven's previous albums, Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans countless times, I cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album. Stevens blatantly rips off his own music. I consider Michigan to be Sufjan's masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and start there
0	TICKED OFF I bought this cd after hearing Tony on one of the am morning shows, and really likings some of his past offerings, but I have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money. I was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money's worth. Tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years, and I expected a more mature offering from him than this latest. There is a great lack of maturity on this cd, and it's an overall disappointment. Unfortunately, I have to say here that Toney is not alone. What on earth possessed veteran soul singers the O'Jays to sing a song like Let's Ride? Who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages? Hoochie mommas? What? Babyface? Even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd! And what's up with the explicit lyrics? We all know you can curse like sailors, but why is this language necessary in music? And I know that artist have always performed their music, but will someone tell me why it's necessary to perform with so few clothes on? I would rather hear your music, not see your booty! Sorry, but a review I just read triggered me, and I'd been thinking about the Tony Terry cd for a while. Hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time. Meanwhile I think you're safe in skipping this particular cd
0	Better Stoned? Um. I have nothing against bands that are "mainstream". That has nothing to do with their quality of sound. (granted, many mainstream bands are horrible, but they all deserve a chance, no?) Dave, though, he has never impressed me. Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing. Just oh so mediocre. I don't understand why is he so highly praised? Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same! Maybe I'm missing something? If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this! You can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song. Two stars because it's at least music. But that's on the high side, considering how static it is. Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer.
0	Born to Croon Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse. Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like
