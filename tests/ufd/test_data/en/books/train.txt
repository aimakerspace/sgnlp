1	Possibly the worst book I have ever read While I realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book, it reminds me of the story, "The Emperor has no clothes". Yes, Choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes, the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying. The "flipping back and forth" was not accomplished in a smooth, flowing manner. In addition, the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved. The kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived. It would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone
0	BORING WITH A TOTAL LACK OF CLARITY I had never read any of Vernor Vinges books before, but i had heard he was an excellent author, so I thought I would try this. Boy, am I glad I bought it used on Amazon for about only $4. I simply had no idea what was going on in this novel. The plot is unintelligible. I dont know what the Bioweapon the jacket refers to is? I dont know what "the Rabbit" is. I see that numerous other reviews here, did not know what was going on either. I do not understand how someone could write so incoherently. The concept of someone who had Alzheimers getting cured & entering a future society is great - but it never goes anywhere. The only reason I did not fall asleep, was that I was trying to figure out what was going on, but I did could not even finish this book
0	Author sneaks in biblical misinterpretation, poor editing. I got this as both a book and an audio file. I had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?). I agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations. Where were his editors when this was being written? Why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities? I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has slipped up on. I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too. What a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me. We are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the Bible well. So far...I may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to the Word itself. I wonder if I can get a refund
0	Horrible Layout The content of this book is adequate, but the layout leaves much to be desired. The only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents. Pages are not labeled with chapter information, such as which chapter that page belongs to. The content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half. This makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book. You can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused. If the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book, I would rate it much higher
1	Please be very careful! This book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth. As some readers have complained, this is not really a "Christian" book because the focus isn't on Christ, it's on YOU. A Biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally, the way Jesus would, and not on trying to "find the perfect spouse." The whole premise of the book is rather un-Christlike: making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you. It's rather selfish, really, when you consider the words of John the Baptist: "Christ must become more, I must become less," as well as the warning in Song of Solomon "Do not awaken love until it so desires." Shouldn't our primary goal be to glorify Christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires? Finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines. Hearts can be broken, and therefore authentic, Christlike love must take precedence. I don't mean to sound accusing, but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls "seduction." My brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a "poser." This happens when 'forcing yourself' to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex. You have to ask: What kind of people are you trying to attract...people who are enticed by your masculinity/femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are? I personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality. It is a combination of both action and faith that is important. Faith to set the situations up. Action to knock em down
