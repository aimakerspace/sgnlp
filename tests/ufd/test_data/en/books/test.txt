However, it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a "fluff piece" than anything else. As someone who has not only served as a Senior Border Patrol Agent (13 years) but also a Border Patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency, I have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job (many say a necessity). Pacheco, as an active agent (when he wrote the book at least), appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target. His somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line (I apologize for the pun) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial. Did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed? If so, then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else. If he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint, then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the Border Patrol and border security. Simply put, the Border Patrol, as with most of the Homeland Security subcomponents is disintegrating. Remember the incompetence of FEMA (a Homeland Security subcomponent)? Well, multiply that incompetence times ten. Heard about the poor morale of FEMA employees? Multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the Border Patrol. A Border Patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out. Those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in DHS. The bottom line is that as a former agent, I lose sleep at night knowing what I know. Pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda. That alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of U.S. Border Patrol Agent. The field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits. Read the book for enjoyment and homage. Just don't expect critical analysis. In fact, this book would be an enjoyable read at Stewarts Bridge (for you IB agents in San Diego).
1	Book review It's an educational book to read. My child and I like reading it together
1	Wonderful Handbook I'm new at reading about energy healing modalities, so I have little to compare it to. I found this book to be a really nice book to learn more about Healing Touch and how to be a practitioner. It has some wonderful stories, some that even made me cry. I still have a long way to go to make this work for me, but it's the beginning of a new awareness in my life

Although few would argue that bridge clubs aren't what they used to be, who would have predicted the rise of 20,000 member mega-churches back in 1962? This underlines the basic problem with this book: it focuses too much on what constituted "communities" and "activities" in the past, without looking at how people form new and different kinds of communities today. While I agree that television has dramatically increased the couch potato index, and participation in traditional FORMAL organizations has declined, I would argue that membership and participation in new kinds of groups that are more relevant to people in the 21st century has risen. For example, while young people famously are less likely to vote in our dual-party system, college students today volunteer more that any generation before them. In addition, while participation in mainline Protestant churches has stedily declined, engagement in evangelical churches has risen dramatically. While I personally feel that the sterile suburban, drive-everywhere-in-my-SUV existance is soul crushing, and the popularity of reality TV may be a sign of the apocolypse, I also don't pine for the days where mom was expected to stay home with the kids and go to the bridge club once a week, while dad worked 9-5, returned home to supper, and went to the Men's Club on Tuesdays at 8. And while Putnam's basic premise may resonate with many, its fetishization of days past blunts the strength of his overall argument

I know the pain of writing for so very long with no recognition. All I can say is that maybe this book can make you feel better temporarily, thinking you have some kind of inside track that nobody else has (LOL), but the only way to get published is to make your own inside track. This book won't help you do it
