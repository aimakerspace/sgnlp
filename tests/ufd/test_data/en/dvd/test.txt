1	kitsch is global A 130-minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality, this Swedish import doesn't so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place, wouldn't know what to do with it if you did have it, and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts. The plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as "well-worn," which seems to be a euphemism for "shop-worn," "clichï¿½," or "stupefyingly unoriginal." Here it is (spoilers follow): Daniel, a big-shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health, returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood, takes over and revives the local church choir, heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life-affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness, finds love, finds his inner child, and finally, at the moment of his and his choir's greatest triumph, croaks. A great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program, but Kay Pollack isn't up to it. Instead, in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness, he celebrates, embraces, wallows in the schmaltz, throws it at you until it's dripping off you like oobleck, and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film. Indeed, there's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last: it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent, albeit of the Ed Wood variety; and while watching it I almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind, as in the Kingsley Amis story about the poet who, at the end of a long and successful career, publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs. (Speaking of whom: "As It Is In Heaven" was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars in 2005, after being strewn with similar honors in Sweden, where it was reportedly seen by some TWO MILLION viewers. We're used to this kind of idiocy from the Academy, but what's going on in the country of Strindberg and Bergman? Has someone been putting something in the kï¿½ttbullar?) A standard feature of movies like this (and books like this, if it comes to that--cf. Ayn Rand) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant. AIIIH is no exception. The parade of didactic marionettes includes: -- Daniel's love interest, a ditzy twenty-year-old blonde, who represents the Life Force; -- the humorless, sexually repressed, hypocritical preacher, who represents The Church, which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity, especially in modern Scandinavia; -- the wife-beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates, and then finally locks up and forgives--who represents Violence and What to Do About It; -- the retarded kid whom Daniel insists on letting into the choir, chiefly so that he can become the film's symbol of the Virtues of Inclusiveness and the Deep Human Wisdom of Special People. (Incidentally, it's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people, in movie after movie, as symbols of purity/goodness/wisdom-beyond-the-ken-of-those-cursed-with-normal-intelligence, or whatever, is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them; it just SEEMS nicer. CAN'T we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being? The only one I can recall seeing is "Best Boy," a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago. Apart from that they've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule, as in "There's Something About Mary," or turned into plaster saints as here.) So, to sum up: save your money and your time, which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of "The O.C." Run, don't walk, from your local art theater if this is the main attraction. And don't forget the moral of the story, rather comforting to me as an expatriate American living in a Europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis-ï¿½-vis the USA: kitsch is global.
1	Chapellle didnt want to do these for a reason... They SUCK! Bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established Chapelle humor. It was like watching Mind of Mencia. Two thumbs down, leave this one alone. Tupac playing in the club was pretty funny though
0	Enough of too much awready! The population of Hong Kong is approximately 7 million people. I'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie. Usually when a movie runs over 2 hours, it's because there's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in. In the case of Hard Boiled, the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by John Woo's desire to get into the Guinness Book of Records for "most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture." Chow Yun-Fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay, and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff. He shoots (usually with a pistol in each hand) while diving headlong over furniture, while swinging from a rope, while sliding down a banister(!), while being hurled through the air by explosions. Sometimes he even shoots while standing still. And he shoots, and shoots, and shoots. And the bad guys shoot, and shoot, and shoot. And Yun-Fat's fellow cops shoot, and shoot, and -- you get the idea. There are some fine action scenes in this film, but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended. There wasn't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next, and it became painfully repetitious. Personally I would highly recommend The Replacement Killers over Hard Boiled. There's plenty of Yun-Fat's balletic shoot-em-up action, but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire
0	The Trinity Collection The movies and stories are classic westerns, the quality is horrible, these are not remastered. It looks like they found the oldest copy of the film and transfered it to DVD. If I didn't like the actual movies, I would not buy knowing the quality
0	It's about kids at a "musical camp" for wannabe performers These are not your typical teens. They love Broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage. So here they are at "Camp Ovation" honing their skills. One of the teachers is a song songwriter. Because he is also a "one hit wonder" he's an angry alcoholic. The other characters (teenagers) are a "fag hag", a cross dresser, a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut, a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self-esteem. There is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie. If you like musicals, you will proberly like this but might bore most people.
